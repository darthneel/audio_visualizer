##Audio Visualizer

---

**Audio Visualizer built with HTML5 AudioContext API and D3.js**

---

*v1* - Expiremental version: Animating expanding and contracting circles to represent frequency changes.

*v2* - Rewrote V1 with prototypes and updated animation flow to be smoother. 

*v3* - Changed animation from circles to bars. Now looks more like a traditional visualizer. [Demo](https://radiant-earth-6712.herokuapp.com/)
